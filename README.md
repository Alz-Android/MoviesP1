# MoviesP1

This Movie App is the first part of a 2 part project. It uses a gridView to show images of the current top 20 movies playing in theatres.  Using the settings menu it can also show the top 20 most highly rated movies. Retrofit2 was used for efficient networking, and Picasso was used for the convennient handling of images.
